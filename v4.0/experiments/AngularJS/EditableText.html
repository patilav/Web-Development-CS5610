        <h2>About this experiment </h2>
        <p>
            Angular JS features two way binding between HTML and JS.
             It follows MVC pattern in which change to model is reflected immediately on the view and vice-versa. 
            This experiment demonstrates this feature in which hello is changed by controller in JS file. 
            Whenever an input is entered view changes as they are binded.
        </p>
        <h2>Code Snippet</h2>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            <pre>
            &lt;input type="text" ng-model="yourName" placeholder="Enter a name here"&gt; <br />

            &lt;h1&gt;Welcome {\{yourName}}  to the Angular JS Tutorial!&lt;/h1&gt;
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Whenever the data changes the data binding is updating the string inside the text!
            Versus the approch in JQuery where we have to wait for the main function to fire off when the document is ready.
            and then you have to lookup for the elementes one way or another whether it's by id or any other way.
            Once you find the elementes you can set listeners on them and then set a callback.
            Sometimes they nest a few deep and then update the data. After that its all set up and done.
        </p>
           <br />
        <p>
            However Angular JS is so simple that basically you write some HTML and sprinkle some expression in data bindings
            and that will update the HTML itself. It's a very drastic difference.
            This shows the power and simplicity of angular.
