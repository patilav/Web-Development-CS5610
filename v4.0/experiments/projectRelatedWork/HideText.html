        <h1>Experiment 1: AngularJS Hiding the data</h1>

        <h2>About this experiment </h2>
        <p>
            Angular JS features two way binding between HTML and JS.
             It follows MVC pattern in which change to model is reflected immediately on the view and vice-versa. 
            This experiment demonstrates this feature of hiding the contents changed by controller in JS file. 
            
        </p>
        <h2>Code Snippet</h2>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            This marks the myVar paragraph  <br />
                &lt;p ng-hide="myVar"&gt; <br />
                First Name: &lt; input type=text ng-model="firstName" &gt; <br />
                Last Name: &lt; input type=text ng-model="lastName" &gt; <br />
                Full Name: {{firstName + " " + lastName}} <br />
            &lt;/p&gt; <br />

            //Function to hide the contents <br />
            $scope.toggle = function () { <br />
            $scope.myVar = !$scope.myVar; <br />
            }; 
        </div>
        <p>
            
            Whenever the data changes the data binding is updating the string inside the text!
            Versus the approch in JQuery where we have to wait for the main function to fire off when the document is ready.
            and then you have to lookup for the elementes one way or another whether it's by id or any other way.
            Once you find the elementes you can set listeners on them and then set a callback.
            Sometimes they nest a few deep and then update the data. After that its all set up and done.
            <br />
            Also here the function to toggle the display of the details of user which can be used to hide/unhide the content of the page. 

        </p>
        <p>
            However Angular JS is so simple that basically you write some HTML and sprinkle some expression in data bindings
            and that will update the HTML itself. It's a very drastic difference.
            This shows the power and simplicity of angular.
