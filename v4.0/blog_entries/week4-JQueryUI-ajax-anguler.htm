<h3>Week 4 - JQuery, AJAX, Angular</h3>
   
    <p>
        So this week dwelling deeper in JQuery ...I have experimenteed with JQuery UI!! 
        As always I was amazed to watch all the ready to use functionalities... <br />
        <b>jQuery UI</b><br />
        jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes 
        built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library. Whether you're building highly interactive web 
        applications or you just need to add a date picker to a form control, jQuery UI is the perfect choice. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        <b>AJAX</b><br />
        Ajax is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Why AngularJS?</b><br />
        HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications.
        AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
