<h3>Week 6 - NodeJS</h3>
   
    <p>
        So this week dwelling deeper in Node JS ...I have experimented with NodeJS and routing with Angular JS!! 
         <br />
    <p>
        <b>NodeJS</b><br />
        Node stands in last but not least place the MEAN stack development.
        Node.js® is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. <br />
         Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, <br />
        perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. <br />
    </p>
	 <p>
        As an asynchronous event driven framework, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. <br />
         In the following examples, many connections can be handled concurrently. <br /> 
         Upon each connection the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done Node is sleeping.<br />
    </p>

<p>
 I have performed below experiments using AngularJS
    <ul>
        <li>1. Node.js json view </li>
        <li>2. Node.js json parsing data </li>
        <li>3. Node.js addition of json data </li>
        <li>4. Node.js CRUD on json data  </li>
        <li>5. Node.js static html data </li>
        
</ul>
</p>
