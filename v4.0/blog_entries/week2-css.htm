<h3>Week 2 - CSS</h3>

<p>Exploring the web seems so much fun ... when you see a web page with fancy colors , fonts and images.. isn't it?
But think about the amount of work to be done if we had to design each page separately and don't even get me started on 
the changes which are required to be done keeping in mind all of that.. Sounds like a tedious task !! Hmm
When programmers become lazy they start looking for shortcuts one of those is the CSS. 
Easy. Effiecient and Handy. So we love it! :)

 Website without CSS like a recipe without the garnishing ;)
