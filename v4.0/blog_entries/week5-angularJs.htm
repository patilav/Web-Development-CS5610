<h3>Week 5 - AngularJS</h3>
   
    <p>
        So this week dwelling deeper in Angular JS ...I have experimented with Angular JS and routing with Angular JS!! 
         <br />
    <p>
        <b>AngularJS</b><br />
        HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications.
        AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

        Angular JS features two way binding between HTML and JS.
        It follows MVC pattern in which change to model is reflected immediately on the view and vice-versa. 
        This experiment demonstrates this feature in which hello is changed by controller in JS file. 
        Whenever an input is entered view changes as they are binded.
