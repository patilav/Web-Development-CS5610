<h3>Week 1 - HTML 5</h3>

<p>So taking web development was much more thrill because I like to explore web technologies 
more than anything else. Cause it's less boring than the unix/linux machines... 
which I truly love but a visual treat is rare in that case :P
</p>

<p>
So coming to the point.. Web Development... There is lots to learn and explore in this field and it has almost no ending...
Starting with the HTML5 Prof Jose went on to teach a lot more about the history of the web and it's languages.. which I had forgotten. 
<ul>
<li>1. Html 5 form samples</li>
<li>2. Html Sections</li>
<li>3. Html Location</li>
<li>4. Html Range</li>
<li>5. Html Web Storage</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I worked with all new elements of HTML5 and CSS stylesheet which were implemented by me in the first 5 experiments.
Out of which almost everything is being used in our day to day lives.
