<h3>Week 8 - Project</h3>
   
I wanted to share the project topic with you and 
get the ideas on how can i get the web apis and other related stuff for the same.

Below is just the basic idea which i came up with
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Online Website for collaboration of Art for all the artists
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than just exhibiting and admiring each others work as isolated individuals, people can get gather to work on projects.Some of them may have some interesting Music created ,painting, Video or just a poem or an article. Other people can comment watch, like and share this material.
Additional scope : Individuals with the same interest can add each other in follower list and will get the updates from their friends. and people can buy the products also made by others.
