        <h2>About the experiment</h2>
        <p>
            With jQuery, you can chain together actions/methods.
            Chaining allows us to run multiple jQuery methods (on the same element) within a 
            single statement.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there is a technique called chaining, that allows us to run multiple jQuery commands, one after the other, on the same element(s).
            Tip: This way, browsers do not have to find the same element(s) more than once.
            To chain an action, you simply append the action to the previous action.
       </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tip:</b> When chaining, the line of code could become quite long. 
            However, jQuery is not very strict on the syntax; you can format it like you want, including line breaks and indentations.
        </p>
        <h2>Code Snippet</h2>
        <div class="code-snippet">
            $(document).ready(function () { <br />
            $("button").click(function () {<br />
            $("#p1").css("color", "blue")<br />
            .slideUp(2000)<br />
            .slideDown(2000);<br />
            });<br />
            });<br />
        </div>
        <p> 
            Here in case of chaining the slideUp and slideDown get called one after the another.. 
            Hence creating a demo where the order of the tasks matter.
            Where slideUp will make p1 to move upwards and slideDown will make p1 to move downwards
        </p>
