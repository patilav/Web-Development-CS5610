<h3>Week 2 - Bootstrap and JQuery</h3>

So I learned about Bootstrap and JQuery for last 2 days and tried to experiment with a few features provided by the system.
 <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
<p>Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.</br>
Designed for everyone, everywhere. Bootstrap makes front-end web development faster and easier. </br>
It's made for folks of all skill levels, devices of all shapes, and projects of all sizes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Bootstrap easily and efficiently scales your websites and applications with a single code base, from phones to tablets to desktops with CSS media queries. </br>
With Bootstrap, you get extensive and beautiful documentation for common HTML elements, dozens of custom HTML and CSS components, and awesome jQuery plugin </br>
Bootstrap ships with vanilla CSS, but its source code utilizes the two most popular CSS preprocessors, Less and Sass. Quickly get started with precompiled CSS or build on the source.
</p>

<p>
 <h4>What is jQuery?</h4>
<p> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
