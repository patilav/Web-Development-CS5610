<h3>Week 3 - JQuery</h3>

    <p>
    JavaScript is fun! To perform all the logic for the handling  of data and validations.. but problem is we need to handle 
    different syntaxes for each browsers... do we really have time to do that?  What if we could only concentrate on the logic 
    and let someone else handle this complex task for us? 
    :)

    <p>
    Right! We have answer for this as well ... JQuery!! 
    So I went ahead exploring the same this week ... and was amazed to watch all the ready to use functionalities...
