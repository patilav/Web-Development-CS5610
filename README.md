<h3>Week 5 - AngularJS</h3>
   
    <p>
        So this week dwelling deeper in Angular JS ...I have experimented with Angular JS and routing with Angular JS!! 
         <br />
    <p>
        <b>AngularJS</b><br />
        HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications.
        AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
    </p>
	 <p>
        Angular JS features two way binding between HTML and JS.
        It follows MVC pattern in which change to model is reflected immediately on the view and vice-versa. 
        This experiment demonstrates this feature in which hello is changed by controller in JS file. 
        Whenever an input is entered view changes as they are binded.
    </p>

<p>
 I have performed below experiments using AngularJS
    <ul>
        <li>1. Angular Intro </li>
        <li>2. Angular Filtering </li>
        <li>3. Angular JS routing</li>
        <li>4. Angular JS Login </li>
        <li>5. Angular Instagram Feed</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Week 4 - JQuery, AJAX, Angular</h3>
   
    <p>
        So this week dwelling deeper in JQuery ...I have experimenteed with JQuery UI!! 
        As always I was amazed to watch all the ready to use functionalities... <br />
        <b>jQuery UI</b><br />
        jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes 
        built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library. Whether you're building highly interactive web 
        applications or you just need to add a date picker to a form control, jQuery UI is the perfect choice. 
    </p><br>
    <p>
        <b>AJAX</b><br />
        Ajax is a group of interrelated Web development techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous Web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Why AngularJS?</b><br />
        HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications.
        AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
    </p>

<p>
 I have performed below experiments using JQuery UI, Ajax and Angular
    <ul>
        <li>1. JQuery UI Basics </li>
        <li>2. JQuery UI Downloader</li>
        <li>3. JQuery UI Navigation</li>
        <li>4. Ajax and Web API </li>
        <li>5. Angular Basics</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>Week 3 - JQuery</h3>

    <p>
    JavaScript is fun! To perform all the logic for the handling  of data and validations.. but problem is we need to handle 
    different syntaxes for each browsers... do we really have time to do that?  What if we could only concentrate on the logic 
    and let someone else handle this complex task for us? 
    :)
    </p>
    <p>
    Right! We have answer for this as well ... JQuery!! 
    So I went ahead exploring the same this week ... and was amazed to watch all the ready to use functionalities...  
    </p>

<p>
 I have performed below experiments using JQuery 
    <ul>
        <li>1. JQuery and Ajax</li>
        <li>2. JQuery chaining</li>
        <li>3. JQuery Fade in/out effects</li>
        <li>4. JQuery filtering</li>
        <li>5. JQuery slide down</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Week 2 - CSS</h3>

<p>Exploring the web seems so much fun ... when you see a web page with fancy colors , fonts and images.. isn't it?
But think about the amount of work to be done if we had to design each page separately and don't even get me started on 
the changes which are required to be done keeping in mind all of that.. Sounds like a tedious task !! Hmm
When programmers become lazy they start looking for shortcuts one of those is the CSS. 
Easy. Effiecient and Handy. So we love it! :)
</p>

<p>
 Website without CSS like a recipe without the garnishing ;)
 So I am going to experiment with CSS in couple of experiments :D
<ul>
<li>1. CSS Basics</li>
<li>2. CSS Transformations</li>
</ul>
</p>



<h3>Week 2 - Bootstrap and JQuery</h3>

So I learned about Bootstrap and JQuery for last 2 days and tried to experiment with a few features provided by the system.
 <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
<p>Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.</br>
Designed for everyone, everywhere. Bootstrap makes front-end web development faster and easier. </br>
It's made for folks of all skill levels, devices of all shapes, and projects of all sizes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Bootstrap easily and efficiently scales your websites and applications with a single code base, from phones to tablets to desktops with CSS media queries. </br>
With Bootstrap, you get extensive and beautiful documentation for common HTML elements, dozens of custom HTML and CSS components, and awesome jQuery plugin </br>
Bootstrap ships with vanilla CSS, but its source code utilizes the two most popular CSS preprocessors, Less and Sass. Quickly get started with precompiled CSS or build on the source.
</p>

<p>
 <h4>What is jQuery?</h4>
<p> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
</p>

<h3>Week 1 - HTML 5</h3>

<p>So taking web development was much more thrill because I like to explore web technologies 
more than anything else. Cause it's less boring than the unix/linux machines... 
which I truly love but a visual treat is rare in that case :P
</p>

<p>
So coming to the point.. Web Development... There is lots to learn and explore in this field and it has almost no ending...
Starting with the HTML5 Prof Jose went on to teach a lot more about the history of the web and it's languages.. which I had forgotten. 
<ul>
<li>1. Html 5 form samples</li>
<li>2. Html Sections</li>
<li>3. Html Location</li>
<li>4. Html Range</li>
<li>5. Html Web Storage</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I worked with all new elements of HTML5 and CSS stylesheet which were implemented by me in the first 5 experiments.
Out of which almost everything is being used in our day to day lives.
